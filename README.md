I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.

Project Description It explores casualities from terrorism and its impact on political stability for the years 2014 to 2016. From our descriptive analysis, we learned that most countries' in the top 20 countries for total casualities caused by terrorism, consistently appeared in the top 20 from 2014 to 2015. Next, we observed terrorism density and its global distribution, which revealed to us which regions experience a greater number of terrorist events and attacks. Then, we visually compared terrorism density to the political stability index and we noticed that many countries with high terrorism density also had a low PSI. However, what was interesting to note is how some countries like Ireland, are very politcally stable, yet they experience a significant amount of terrorism. After that we resorted to a more quantitative analytical approach through OLS regressions. We learned that although terrorism does not explain much of political instability, political stability holds a strong inverse relationship with terrorism casualities.
